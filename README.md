# masters_research_code

Repository is for the code needed for my Master's Research.

The research is focused around using a online distributed EM algorithm for Finite Mixture Modelling FMM. The main focus will be on Poisson Mixture Model.

The idea of the research originates from a paper from Qian Wang, Guangbao Guo, Guoqi Qian and Xuejun Jiang called "Distributed online expectation-maximization algorithm for
Poisson mixture model".
